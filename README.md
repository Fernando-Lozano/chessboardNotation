Notes:
I want the rotating animation to first shrink, rotate, and the expand back out so that the chessboard isn't cut off.
Add an about tab and remove description.
When the chessboard is rotated the highlighted square or column needs to be redrawn somehow

Tasks:
  learn class methods
  add movement functions to class method
  get ease functions for the scaling of chessboard

Todo:
construct a class for the chess board
  it should keep track of rotated state
  what to practice(row, column, squares)
  functions to animate rotations
for each row, column, square selected
  generate random question for user
  add answer to options along with three other possible answers
if one of the options is selected check if right or wrong
give time limit like in the mental math calculator
add animations to rotate the board

Log:
main layout is done
