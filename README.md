Notes:
I want the rotating animation to first shrink, rotate, and the expand back out so that the chessboard isn't cut off.
Add an about tab and remove description.
When the chessboard is rotated the highlighted square or column needs to be redrawn somehow

Todo:
add animations to rotate the board
construct a class for the chess board
  it should keep track of rotated state
  what to practice(row, column, squares)
  functions to animate rotations
for each row, column, square selected
  generate random question for user
  add answer to options along with three other possible answers
if one of the options is selected check if right or wrong
give time limit like in the mental math calculator

main layout is done
