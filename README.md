Notes:
I want the rotating animation to first shrink, rotate, and the expand back out so that the chessboard isn't cut off.
Add an about tab and remove description.
When the chessboard is rotated the highlighted square or column needs to be redrawn somehow

Tasks:
  remove all unecessarry classes

Log:
