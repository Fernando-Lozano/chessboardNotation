Notes:
I want the rotating animation to first shrink, rotate, and the expand back out so that the chessboard isn't cut off.
Add an about tab and remove description.
When the chessboard is rotated the highlighted square or column needs to be redrawn somehow

Tasks:
  initialize
  making game work
  allow for game to change modes

Todo:
for each row, column, square selected
  generate random question for user
  add answer to options along with three other possible answers
if one of the options is selected check if right or wrong
give time limit like in the mental math calculator
style answer buttons

Log:
main layout is done
board rotates
commented procedure of coding
